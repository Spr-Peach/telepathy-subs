# Telepathy Subs — macOS Subtitle Overlay for YouTube (Safari)

Telepathy Subs is a lightweight macOS utility that displays clean, floating subtitles while you watch YouTube videos in Safari.  
It extracts captions in real time and shows them in a resizable, movable overlay so nothing on your screen is ever blocked.

- **Switch instantly** between original captions and translated text

## 🌐 Translated Subtitles

Telepathy Subs can optionally integrate with local language model tools for enhanced subtitle translation.
This integration is optional and not required for the primary subtitle overlay functionality,
but it can improve the experience when videos provide limited caption language options.

## 📌 Compatibility Notes

Telepathy Subs works best with **standard YouTube video pages** in Safari.  
Different layouts or experimental features may affect behavior, and compatibility will continue improving over time.
